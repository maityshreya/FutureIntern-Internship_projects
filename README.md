# House Price Prediction

This project implements a house price prediction system using Linear Regression. It is built as an end-to-end machine-learning project using Flask.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the price of houses based on various features such as location, total square feet area, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms.

## Features

- Predicts house prices based on input features.
- Provides a web interface to interact with the prediction model.
- Uses a Linear Regression algorithm for prediction.
- Implements an end-to-end machine learning project.

  ## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `app.py`: Flask web application for serving predictions.
- `model/`: Directory containing trained model and preprocessing objects.
- `dataset/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training.
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the web interface.

  ## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- scikit-learn
